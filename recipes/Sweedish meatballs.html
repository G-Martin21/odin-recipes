        <h3>Serves 4</h3>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 tbs of breadcrumbs</li>
          <li>50 ml single cream</li>
          <li>1 egg</li>
          <li>1 tbs concentrated stock from beef, calf or chicken</li>
          <li>0.5 finely chopped yellow onion</li>
          <li>25 g butter</li>
          <li>500 g ground mince (half pork and beef)</li>
          <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>about 1.5 tsp of salt</li>
          <li>Butter to fry in</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2.5 dl double cream</li>
          <li>1,5 tsp dark soy</li>
          <li>2.5 dl beef stock (not concentrated)</li>
          <li>25 g butter</li>
          <li>
            1 tbs corn starch (or something similar) to thicken the sauce with
          </li>
          <li>salt and pepper</li>
          <li>2 tbs jam from lingonberries or cherries</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>To serve:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>mashed potatoes</li>
          <li>lingonberry jam</li>
          <li>chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Fold together bread crumbs, cream, stock and egg and leave to rest
            for about 5 minutes. </li>
           <li>Fry the onion in the butter until soft and then
            mix it with the breadcrumb-cream. Add salt, pepper and mince and
            work everything together, with your hands or fork. Try not to work
            it too much, as this will make the meatballs compact.</li> 
            <li>Take a small piece of mince and fry it to test the flavours. When satisfied with
            salt and pepper, roll the rest of the mince to small balls (about
            one tablespoon mince per ball) Make sure your hands are wet with
            water, then the mince won't stick to your hands.</li> 
            <li>Fry the meatballs until golden brown and thoroughly cooked, then put aside.</li>
            <li>Mix cream
            and the corn starch and then pour this, stock and the soy in the pan
            where you fried the meatballs. Whisk through the pan and let boil
            for a couple of minutes. Taste with salt, pepper and jam for a
            little bit of sweetness. </li> 
            <li>Put the meatballs back to the sauce and serve with mashed potatoes and lingonberry jam, maybe some chopped
            parsley on top too.</li> 
          </li>
        </ol>
