          <h3>Method</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Begin with the starter. Dissolve the yeast in the milk, either by
              hand or in a stand mixer. Add the sugar and flour and work
              everything to an elastic dough. About 5 minutes in the stand mixer
              or 10 minutes by hand. Cover the dough and leave to rise to double
              size in room temperature for about 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the ingredients of the finish to the starter and work until
              the dough is shiny and elastic. About 15 minutes by hand or 10
              minutes in stand mixer. Don´t cheat with this, you want a lot of
              gluten in the dough and a really elastic dough. On a floured
              surface, divide the dough into small pieces, all weighing about 70
              grams each. Round-roll (roll) to smooth round buns and gently
              transfer them to a baking sheet covered with baking paper. Make
              sure to leave some space between the buns as they will grow to
              about double the size) Leave the buns covered to rise to about
              double the size.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile, make the almond paste. Toast the almonds gently, let
              them cool and then mix almonds and sugar into a smooth almond
              paste. If it´s to dry, try adding just a little bit of water. With
              this almond paste as base, then make the filling. Mix (not in
              machine) together all ingredients for the filling until it has
              come together to a nice smooth paste with some chunky almond bits
              in it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake the buns in the middle of the oven at about 225 °C (430F) for
              about 10-13 minutes until they are golden. Let cool on a wire
              rack.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut the lids of the bun with a scissor (or use a knife) Make a
              small well in the middle by taking some of the inside out with a
              fork. Fill this hole with the filling, the larger the hole the
              more filling. (and you want a lot of filling!) Top with as much
              whipped cream as desired. Put the lid on gently and sprinkle with
              powdered sugar and serve.
