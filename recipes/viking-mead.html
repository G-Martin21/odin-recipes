        <h2>¿What is mead?</h2>
        <p>
          Mead (/miːd/), or fermented honey water, is an alcoholic beverage,
          sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or hops. The alcoholic
          content ranges from about 3.5% ABV to more than 18%. The defining
          characteristic of mead is that the majority of the beverage's
          fermentable sugar is derived from honey. It may be still, carbonated,
          or naturally sparkling; dry, semi-sweet, or sweet.

        <h3>Ingredients for making mead</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>¾ cup (236 ml) honey (raw if possible)</li>
          <li>3 cups (946 ml) room temperature water</li>
          <li>
            ¼ teaspoon (1.2g) Lalvin D47 Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a common and
            inexpensive wine yeast), or other type of yeast
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps to prepare mead</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Clean equipment with soap and water. If you prefer and have it
            available, disinfect all equipment with ethanol. However, this step
            is not necessary. You will be adding such huge quantities of yeast
            that they will outcompete other microbes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rehydrate the dried yeast in 50ml of water at 40-43ºC (104-109ºF).
            You can make mead with a variety of yeasts: natural yeast from raw
            honey, champagne yeast, bread yeast… If you are feeling ambitious,
            make different batches with different yeast varieties and compare
            the fermentation rate and final flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix water and honey in the jar. Stir until the honey fully
            dissolves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the yeast to the jar. This process is called “pitching the
            yeast”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return the mead to the jar and cork it with an airlock cap or a
            balloon. You can also very loosely cover it with a traditional mason
            jar lid, but you will need to check that it remains loose daily, and
            “burp” the jar to release the pressure so the jar does not shatter.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 3 or 4 days (more if the room is cold, less if it’s hot), the
            brew should be bubbly and fragrant. Once it’s bubbly, you can
            transfer the mead into a clean jar, however this is not necessary.
            Do not transfer the yeast “sludge” that has developed on the bottom
            of the jar (it is not unhealthy, but it is also not delicious).
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave the mead for another 2-4 weeks, until bubbling slows. Make
            sure to stop the fermentation before the yeast consume all of the
            sugar. The final product should still be sweet, slightly alcoholic,
            and preferably have some fizz. Taste the mead every couple of days.
            If you would like your final mead fizzy, you can seal the jar for
            the last few days to lock in the carbon dioxide. Be careful with
            this last step - if you seal your jar in the first 1-2 weeks and
            there are still many remaining sugars, the yeast will produce more
            carbon dioxide than the mason jar can contain and the jar will
            explode.
          </li>
          <li>After 2-4 weeks, your mead is done! Drink it now, or age it.</li>
